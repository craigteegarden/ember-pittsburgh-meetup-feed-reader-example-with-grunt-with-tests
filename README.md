Ember.js Pittsburgh Meetup Feed Reader With Grunt
===========

This is a very simple example of a working (barely) feed reader built using Ember.js and [Yahoo's YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) for the [Ember.js Pittsburgh Meetup on Feb 20, 2014](http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Pittsburgh/events/161103052/). It modifies the [ember-pittsburgh-meetup-feed-reader-example](https://github.com/craigteegarden/ember-pittsburgh-meetup-feed-reader-example) example project to use Grunt to build the project.

It is based on the [Ember starter kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit).

###Grunt

For more details on getting started with Grunt, check out the [Grunt getting started guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

###Building this project with Grunt

Make sure the [grunt-cli is installed](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)

Install the project's node dependencies

````javascript
npm install
````
run Grunt

````javascript
grunt
````
###Running the tests
After building the project using `grunt`, launch the `tests/index.html` file in a browser to launch the integration and unit tests (qunit).

Tests are also able to be run on the commandline using the `grunt-contrib-qunit` package to execute the tests in phantoms, a headless webbrowser. Make sure to build the project with `grunt` first.

````javascript
grunt qunit
````
